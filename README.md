# I Know That Word

This project is a memory training exercise that focuses on improving recent verbal episodic memory. It is particularly useful for tasks where recognizing previously heard information is important, such as engaging in conversations, watching movies, or going grocery shopping.

The game involves presenting the player with a sequence of words one by one. Each word appears on the screen for 5 seconds and then disappears, followed by the next word. The player's objective is to memorize the words as they appear.

After the series of words to be memorized, the game presents a list with twice the number of words shown. For each word, the player must indicate whether the word was included in the memorized list or not. They have 7 seconds to respond, and failing to do so will be considered an error.

The player starts at level 1 and can only progress to the next level upon successfully completing the current level. The program keeps track of the player's progress and the level they reached, ensuring that when a player restarts the game, they are presented with the appropriate level to play.
